Description: The 'citsr' package provides tools for Controlled Interrupted Time Series (CITS) analysis. 
    It allows users to prepare and manipulate panel time-series data, fit GLS-based CITS models with optional 
    ARMA(p,q) autocorrelation, calculate fitted values with robust standard errors (CR2), and visualize results. 
    Additionally, the package supports plotting counterfactual scenarios for treatment groups after interventions,
    enabling clear interpretation of intervention effects in comparative time-series studies.
